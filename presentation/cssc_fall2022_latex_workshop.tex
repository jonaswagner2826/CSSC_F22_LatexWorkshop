    \begin{itemize}
    \item It makes beautiful documents
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Especially mathematics

    \item It was created by scientists, for scientists
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A large and active community
    \end{itemize}
    %
    \item It is powerful --- you can extend it

    \begin{frame}[fragile]{How does it work?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item You write your document in \texttt{plain text} with \cmd{commands} that
    describe its structure and meaning.
    \item The \texttt{latex} program processes your text and commands to produce a
    beautifully formatted document.

    \item A minimal \LaTeX{} document:
    \inputminted[frame=single]{latex}{basics.tex}
    \item Commands start with a \emph{backslash} \keystrokebftt{\bs}.
    \item Every document starts with a \cmdbs{documentclass} command.
    \item The \emph{argument} in curly braces \keystrokebftt{\{} \keystrokebftt{\}} tells \LaTeX{} what kind of document we are creating: an \bftt{article}.
    \item A percent sign \keystrokebftt{\%} starts a \emph{comment} --- \LaTeX{}
    will ignore the rest of the line.

    \subsection{Typesetting Text}
    \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}}
    \small
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Type your text between \cmdbegin{document} and \cmdend{document}.
    \item For the most part, you can just type your text normally.
    \begin{exampletwouptiny}
    Words are separated by one or more
    spaces.
    
    Paragraphs are separated by one
    or more blank lines.
    \end{exampletwouptiny}
    \item Space in the source file is collapsed in the output.
    \begin{exampletwouptiny}
    The   rain       in Spain
    falls mainly on the plain.
    \end{exampletwouptiny}
    \end{itemize}

%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}: Caveats}
%     \small
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Quotation marks are a bit tricky:\\
%     use a backtick \keystroke{\`{}} on the left and an apostrophe \keystroke{\'{}} on the right.
%     \begin{exampletwouptiny}
%     Single quotes: `text'.
    
%     Double quotes: ``text''.
%     \end{exampletwouptiny}
    
%     \item Some common characters have special meanings in \LaTeX:\\[1ex]
%     \begin{tabular}{cl}
%     \keystrokebftt{\%} & percent sign              \\
%     \keystrokebftt{\#} & hash (pound / sharp) sign \\
%     \keystrokebftt{\&} & ampersand                 \\
%     \keystrokebftt{\$} & dollar sign               \\
%     \end{tabular}
%     \item If you just type these, you'll get an error. If you want one to appear in
%     the output, you have to \emph{escape} it by preceding it with a backslash.
%     \begin{exampletwoup}
%     \$\%\&\#!
%     \end{exampletwoup}
%     \end{itemize}
%     \end{frame}
    
%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     \begin{frame}[fragile]{Handling Errors}
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item \LaTeX{} can get confused when it is trying to compile your document. If
%     it does, it stops with an error, which you must fix before it will produce
%     any output.
%     \item For example, if you misspell \cmdbs{emph} as \cmdbs{meph}, \LaTeX{} will
%     stop with an ``undefined control sequence'' error, because ``meph'' is not
%     one of the commands it knows.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \begin{block}{Advice on Errors}
%     \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Don't panic! Errors happen.
%     \item Fix them as soon as they arise --- if what you just typed caused an error,
%     you can start your debugging there.
%     \item If there are multiple errors, start with the first one --- the cause may
%     even be above it.
%     \end{enumerate}
%     \end{block}

%     \footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States}}}
%     In March 2006, Congress raised that ceiling an additional \$0.79 trillion to

%     ``Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008'' raised the current debt ceiling
%     to \$11.3 trillion.

%     \subsection{Typesetting Mathematics}
%     \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}: Dollar Signs}
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Why are dollar signs \keystrokebftt{\$} special? We use them to mark mathematics in text.\\[1ex]
%     \begin{exampletwouptiny}
%     % not so good:
%     Let a and b be distinct positive
%     integers, and let c = a - b + 1.
    
%     % much better:
%     Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive
%     integers, and let $c = a - b + 1$.
%     \end{exampletwouptiny}
%     \item Always use dollar signs in pairs --- one to begin the mathematics, and one
%     to end it.
%     \item \LaTeX{} handles spacing automatically; it ignores your spaces.
%     \begin{exampletwouptiny}
%     Let $y=mx+b$ be \ldots
    
%     Let $y = m x + b$ be \ldots
%     \end{exampletwouptiny}
%     \end{itemize}
%     \end{frame}
    
%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}: Notation}
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Use caret \keystrokebftt{\^} for superscripts and underscore \keystrokebftt{\_} for subscripts.
%     \begin{exampletwouptiny}
%     $y = c_2 x^2 + c_1 x + c_0$
%     \end{exampletwouptiny}
%     \vskip 2ex
    
%     \item Use curly braces \keystrokebftt{\{} \keystrokebftt{\}} to group
%     superscripts and subscripts.
%     \begin{exampletwouptiny}
%     $F_n = F_n-1 + F_n-2$     % oops!
    
%     $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ % ok!
%     \end{exampletwouptiny}
%     \vskip 2ex
    
%     \item There are commands for Greek letters and common notation.
%     \begin{exampletwouptiny}
%     $\mu = A e^{Q/RT}$
    
%     $\Omega = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \omega_k$
%     \end{exampletwouptiny}

%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}: Displayed Equations}
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item If it's big and scary, \emph{display} it on its own line using
%     \cmdbegin{equation} and \cmdend{equation}.\\[2ex]
%     \begin{exampletwouptiny}
%     The roots of a quadratic equation
%     are given by
%     \begin{equation}
%     x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}
%              {2a}
%     \end{equation}
%     where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are \ldots
%     \end{exampletwouptiny}
%     \vskip 1em
%     {\scriptsize Caution: \LaTeX{} mostly ignores your spaces in mathematics, but it
%     can't handle blank lines in equations --- don't put blank lines in your
%     mathematics.}
%     \end{itemize}
%     \end{frame}
    
%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     \begin{frame}[fragile]{Interlude: Environments}
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item \bftt{equation} is an \emph{environment} --- a context.
%     \item A command can produce different output in different contexts.
%     \begin{exampletwouptiny}
%     We can write
%     $ \Omega = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \omega_k $
%     in text, or we can write
%     \begin{equation}
%       \Omega = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \omega_k
%     \end{equation}
%     to display it.
%     \end{exampletwouptiny}
%     \vskip 2ex
%     \item Note how the $\Sigma$ is bigger in the \bftt{equation} environment, and
%     how the subscripts and superscripts change position, even though we used the
%     same commands.
%     \vskip 1em
%     {\scriptsize In fact, we could have written \bftt{\$...\$} as
%     \cmdbegin{math}\bftt{...}\cmdend{math}.}

%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     \begin{frame}[fragile]{Interlude: Environments}
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item The \cmdbs{begin} and \cmdbs{end} commands are used to create many
%     different environments.
%     \vskip 2ex
    
%     \item The \bftt{itemize} and \bftt{enumerate} environments generate lists.
%     \begin{exampletwouptiny}
%     \begin{itemize} % for bullet points
%     \item Biscuits
%     \item Tea
%     \end{itemize}

%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     \begin{frame}[fragile]{Interlude: Packages}
    
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item All of the commands and environments we've used so far are built into
%     \LaTeX.
    
%     \item \emph{Packages} are libraries of extra commands and environments. There
%     are thousands of freely available packages.
    
%     \item We have to load each of the packages we want to use with a
%     \cmdbs{usepackage} command in the \emph{preamble}.
    
%     \item Example: \bftt{amsmath} from the American Mathematical Society.
%     \begin{minted}[fontsize=\small,frame=single]{latex}
%     \documentclass{article}
%     \usepackage{amsmath} % preamble
%     \begin{document}
%     % now we can use commands from amsmath here...

%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{}: Examples with \bftt{amsmath}}
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Use \bftt{equation*} (``equation-star'') for unnumbered equations.
%     \begin{exampletwouptiny}
%     \begin{equation*}
%       \Omega = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \omega_k
%     \end{equation*}
%     \end{exampletwouptiny}
%     \item \LaTeX{} treats adjacent letters as variables multiplied together, which
%     is not always what you want. \bftt{amsmath} defines commands for many common
%     mathematical operators.
%     \begin{exampletwouptiny}
%     \begin{equation*} % bad!
%      min_{x,y} (1-x)^2 + 100(y-x^2)^2
%     \end{equation*}
%     \begin{equation*} % good!
%     \min_{x,y}{(1-x)^2 + 100(y-x^2)^2}
%     \end{equation*}
%     \end{exampletwouptiny}
%     \item You can use \cmdbs{operatorname} for others.
%     \begin{exampletwouptiny}
%     \begin{equation*}
%     \beta_i =
%     \frac{\operatorname{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}
%          {\operatorname{Var}(R_m)}
%     \end{equation*}

% \subsection{Graphics}
% \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Requires the \bftt{graphicx} package, which provides the

% \item Supported graphics formats include JPEG, PNG and PDF (usually).
% \end{itemize}
% \begin{exampletwouptiny}
% \includegraphics[

% \begin{frame}[fragile]{Interlude: Optional Arguments}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item We use square brackets \keystrokebftt{[} \keystrokebftt{]} for optional
% arguments, instead of braces \keystrokebftt{\{} \keystrokebftt{\}}.
% \item \cmdbs{includegraphics} accepts optional arguments that allow you to transform the
% image when it is included. For example, \bftt{width=0.3\cmdbs{textwidth}} makes
% the image take up 30\% of the width of the surrounding text (\cmdbs{textwidth}).
% \item \cmdbs{documentclass} accepts optional arguments, too. Example:
% \mint{latex}|\documentclass[12pt,twocolumn]{article}|
% \vskip 3ex
% makes the text bigger (12pt) and puts it into two columns.
% \item Where do you find out about these? See the slides at the end of this

% \subsection{Tables}
% \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Tables in \LaTeX{} take some getting used to.
% \item Use the \bftt{tabular} environment from the \bftt{tabularx} package.
% \item The argument specifies column alignment --- \textbf{l}eft, \textbf{r}ight, \textbf{r}ight.
% \begin{exampletwouptiny}
% \begin{tabular}{lrr}
% Item   & Qty & Unit \$ \\
% Widget & 1   & 199.99  \\
% Gadget & 2   & 399.99  \\
% Cable  & 3   & 19.99   \\
% \end{tabular}
% \end{exampletwouptiny}
% \item It also specifies vertical lines; use \cmdbs{hline} for horizontal lines.
% \begin{exampletwouptiny}
% \begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|} \hline
% Item   & Qty & Unit \$ \\\hline
% Widget & 1   & 199.99  \\
% Gadget & 2   & 399.99  \\
% Cable  & 3   & 19.99   \\\hline
% \end{tabular}
% \end{exampletwouptiny}
% \item Use an ampersand \keystrokebftt{\&} to separate columns and a double backslash \keystrokebftt{\bs}\keystrokebftt{\bs} to start a new row (like in the \bftt{align*} environment that we saw in part 1).

% \subsection{bib\TeX}
% \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 1}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Put your references in a \bftt{.bib} file in `bibtex' database format:
% \inputminted[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single]{latex}{bib-example.bib}
% \item Most reference managers can export to bibtex format.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 2}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Each entry in the \bftt{.bib} file has a \emph{key} that you can use to
% reference it in the document. For example, \bftt{Jacobson1999Towards} is the key for this article:
% \begin{minted}[fontsize=\small,frame=single]{latex}
% @Article{Jacobson1999Towards,
%   author = {Van Jacobson},
%   ...
% }
% \end{minted}
% \item It's a good idea to use a key based on the name, year and title.
% \item \LaTeX{} can automatically format your in-text citations and generate a
% list of references; it knows most standard styles, and you can design your own.
% \end{itemize}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 3}

%   features named \bftt{biblatex} but most of the articles templates still use
%   \bftt{natbib}.} with \cmdbs{citet} and \cmdbs{citep}.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item On Windows: \href{http://miktex.org/}{Mik\TeX} or \href{http://tug.org/texlive/}{\TeX Live}
% \item On Linux: \href{http://tug.org/texlive/}{\TeX Live}
% \item On Mac: \href{http://tug.org/mactex/}{Mac\TeX}
% \end{itemize}
% \item You'll also want a text editor with \LaTeX{} support. See \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors} for a list of (many) options.
% \item You'll also have to know more about how \bftt{latex} and its related tools

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \tikzname{} is a package for drawing figures in \LaTeX.
% \item It defines a powerful drawing language inside \LaTeX{}. Short programs can
% draw surprisingly complicated things.
% \begin{figure}
% \href{http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/rotated-triangle/}{%
%   \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{rotated-triangle}}
% \end{figure}
% \item We'll start with simple things. To draw a line in \tikzname:
% \vskip 1ex
% \begin{exampletwouptiny}
% \begin{tikzpicture}
% \draw (0,0) -- (1,1); % a line
% \end{tikzpicture}
% \end{exampletwouptiny}

% \node[above right] at (3,3) {$(3,3)$};
% \node[above left] at (0,3) {$(0,3)$};
% \end{tikzpicture}
% \end{figure}
% \item It helps to draw a grid when you are working with \tikzname:
% \vskip 1ex
% \begin{exampletwouptiny}

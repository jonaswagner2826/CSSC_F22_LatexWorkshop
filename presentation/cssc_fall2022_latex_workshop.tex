\subsection{Graphics}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires the \bftt{graphicx} package, which provides the
\cmdbs{includegraphics} command.
\item Supported graphics formats include JPEG, PNG and PDF (usually).
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Interlude: Optional Arguments}
\begin{itemize}
\item We use square brackets \keystrokebftt{[} \keystrokebftt{]} for optional
arguments, instead of braces \keystrokebftt{\{} \keystrokebftt{\}}.
\item \cmdbs{includegraphics} accepts optional arguments that allow you to transform the
image when it is included. For example, \bftt{width=0.3\cmdbs{textwidth}} makes
the image take up 30\% of the width of the surrounding text (\cmdbs{textwidth}).
\item \cmdbs{documentclass} accepts optional arguments, too. Example:
\verb|\documentclass[12pt,twocolumn]{article}|
\vskip 3ex
makes the text bigger (12pt) and puts it into two columns.
\item Where do you find out about these? See the slides at the end of this
presentation for links to more information.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection[fragile]{Floats}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Allow \LaTeX{} to decide where the figure will go (it can ``float'').
\item You can also give the figure a caption, which can be referenced with
\cmdbs{ref}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{minipage}{0.55\linewidth}

\subsection{Tables}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tables in \LaTeX{} take some getting used to.
% \item Use the \bftt{tabular} environment from the \bftt{tabularx} package.
\item The argument specifies column alignment --- \textbf{l}eft, \textbf{r}ight, \textbf{r}ight.
\begin{figure}
    % \centering
    \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
        \begin{lstlisting}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
    Item   & Qty & Unit \$ \\
    Widget & 1   & 199.99  \\
    Gadget & 2   & 399.99  \\
    Cable  & 3   & 19.99   \\
\end{tabular}
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}

        Widget & 1   & 199.99  \\
        Gadget & 2   & 399.99  \\
        Cable  & 3   & 19.99   \\
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\item It also specifies vertical lines; use \cmdbs{hline} for horizontal lines.
\begin{figure}
    % \centering
    \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
        \begin{lstlisting}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|} \hline
    Item   & Qty & Unit \$ \\\hline
    Widget & 1   & 199.99  \\
    Gadget & 2   & 399.99  \\
    Cable  & 3   & 19.99   \\\hline

            Cable  & 3   & 19.99   \\\hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\item Use an ampersand \keystrokebftt{\&} to separate columns and a double backslash \keystrokebftt{\bs}\keystrokebftt{\bs} to start a new row.

\subsection{bib\TeX}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Put your references in a \bftt{.bib} file in `bibtex' database format:
% \inputminted[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single]{latex}{bib-example.bib}
\begin{lstlisting}
@Article{Jacobson1999Towards,
author = {Van Jacobson},
title = {Towards the Analysis of Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games},
journal = {Journal of Ubiquitous Information},
Year = 1999,
Volume = 6,
Pages = {75--83}}

@InProceedings{Brooks1997Methodology,
author = {Fredrick P. Brooks and John Kubiatowicz and Christos Papadimitriou},
title = {A Methodology for the Study of the Location-Identity Split},
booktitle = {Proceedings of OOPSLA},
Year = 1997}
\end{lstlisting}
\item Most reference managers can export to bibtex format. \\
(Easy to get from Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, etc.)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each entry in the \bftt{.bib} file has a \emph{key} that you can use to
reference it in the document. For example, \bftt{Jacobson1999Towards} is the key for this article:
\begin{lstlisting}
@Article{Jacobson1999Towards,
  author = {Van Jacobson},
  ...
}
\end{lstlisting}
\item It's a good idea to use a key based on the name, year and title.
\item \LaTeX{} can automatically format your in-text citations and generate a
list of references; it knows most standard styles, and you can design your own.
\end{itemize}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection{} 3}

%   features named \bftt{biblatex} but most of the articles templates still use
%   \bftt{natbib}.} with \cmdbs{citet} and \cmdbs{citep}.
% \item Reference \cmdbs{bibliography} at the end, and specify a \cmdbs{bibliographystyle}.

\subsection{More Neat Things}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Add the \cmdbs{tableofcontents} command to generate a table of contents
from the \cmdbs{section} commands.

\item Change the \cmdbs{documentclass} to
\verb|\documentclass{scrartcl}|
or
\verb|\documentclass[12pt]{IEEEtran}|\\
(Use templates!)

\item Define your own command for a complicated equation:
\begin{figure}
    % \centering
    \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
        \begin{lstlisting}          
\newcommand{\rperf}{%
\rho_{\text{perf}}}
$$
\rperf = {\bf c}'{\bf X} + \varepsilon
$$
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}      
\newcommand{\rperf}{%
\rho_{\text{perf}}}
$$
\rperf = {\bf c}'{\bf X} + \varepsilon
$$
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
See https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Commands for good documentation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{More Neat Packages}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item \bftt{beamer}: for presentations (like this one!)
\item \bftt{todonotes}: comments and TODO management
\item \bftt{tikz}: make amazing graphics
\item \bftt{pgfplots}: create graphs in \LaTeX
\item \bftt{listings}: source code printer for \LaTeX
\item \bftt{spreadtab}: create spreadsheets in \LaTeX
\item \bftt{gchords}, \bftt{guitar}: guitar chords and tabulature
\item \bftt{cwpuzzle}: crossword puzzles
\item \bftt{algorithm2e}: for writing algorithms
\item \bftt{xcolor}: add colors to text and elements
\end{itemize}
% See \url{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples} and \url{http://texample.net}
% for examples of (most of) these packages.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Installing \LaTeX{}}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item To run \LaTeX{} on your own computer, you'll want to use a \LaTeX{} \emph{distribution}. A distribution includes a \bftt{latex} program and (typically) several thousand packages:
\href{http://miktex.org/}{Mik\TeX} (Windows), \href{http://tug.org/texlive/}{\TeX Live} (Windows or Linux), and \href{http://tug.org/mactex/}{Mac\TeX} (Mac)
% \begin{itemize}
% \item On Windows: \href{http://miktex.org/}{Mik\TeX} or \href{http://tug.org/texlive/}{\TeX Live}
% \item On Linux: \href{http://tug.org/texlive/}{\TeX Live}
% \item On Mac: \href{http://tug.org/mactex/}{Mac\TeX}
% \end{itemize}
\item You'll also want a text editor with \LaTeX{} support. See \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors} for a list of (many) options.
\item You'll also have to know more about how \bftt{latex} and its related tools
work --- see the resources on the next slide.
\end{itemize}
My suggestion: \textbf{VS Code with LaTeX Workshop extension} \\ 
(Easy install w/ everything included and can can be linked to GitHub \& Overleaf)
\end{frame}

% \section{Drawings with \protect\tikzname}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \tikzname{} is a package for drawing figures in \LaTeX.
% \item It defines a powerful drawing language inside \LaTeX{}. Short programs can
% draw surprisingly complicated things.
% \begin{figure}
% \href{http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/rotated-triangle/}{%
%   \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{rotated-triangle}}
% \end{figure}
% \item We'll start with simple things. To draw a line in \tikzname:
% \vskip 1ex
% \begin{exampletwouptiny}
% \begin{tikzpicture}
% \draw (0,0) -- (1,1); % a line
% \end{tikzpicture}
% \end{exampletwouptiny}
% \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Coordinates}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The default coordinates are centimeters, with the usual sense:

% \node[above right] at (3,3) {$(3,3)$};
% \node[above left] at (0,3) {$(0,3)$};
% \end{tikzpicture}
% \end{figure}
% \item It helps to draw a grid when you are working with \tikzname:
% \vskip 1ex
% \begin{exampletwouptiny}
% \begin{tikzpicture}
% \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);

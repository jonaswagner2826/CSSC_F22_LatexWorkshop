## Presentation

The introductory presentation is adapted from [this github repository](https://github.com/jdleesmiller/latex-course) under a permissive MIT license.

We will introduce the absolute basics of using LaTeX, mathematic typesetting, environments and packages.
Then we will discuss document structures with figures, references, and custom commands for creating reports (or other documents) from templates.
With time permitted, we will then touch on advanced capabilities like creating presentations or posters with Beamer or diagrams and figures using TikZ.
Ultimately, we will ensure everyone is pointed to the resources to implement whatever they want to create with LaTeX.

## Q&A
Following the presentation, a question and answer session will be held alongside the main workshop.
Questions will be fielded from Teams messages and from members of the audience.

## Walkthrough
For begineers, we will be starting by completing Overleaf's [Learn LaTeX in 30 Miniutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) tutorial.

We will assist those already comfortable with the fundamentals progress on their own projects or by gaining new skills using templates, overleaf documentation, and other online resources.
